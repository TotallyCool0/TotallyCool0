Hi! I am TotallyCool! ( Get it? ;p )

I have *The Cherry On Top*, my PiHole blocklists on here. That is the entire reason I started my GitHub account.
It is my personal lists that I decided I wanted blocked on my network. I think I have the more biased ones
well sorted so if you use Pihole, please take a look! I have some good stuff that you might like!
